\section{Gaussian Filters}

\subsection{1D Gaussian Filter}
We implemented the 1D Gaussian in \verb+gaussian.m+.
We made sure the kernel size is about $3*\sigma$ and is always odd.
For this purpose we used the formula $2 * \lfloor 1.5 * \sigma \rfloor + 1$.

Because the filter has a finite size, the sum of the filter values will not be one in a naive implementation.
For this reason, we must normalize the kernel after calculating the values of the Gaussian at each kernel entry.
To save computation, we used the following equality:

\begin{align*}
 \frac{G_{\sigma}(x)}{\sum_{x'=-h}^h G_{\sigma}(x')} &= \frac{ \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp(-\frac{x^2}{2 \sigma^2})}
       {\sum_{x'=-h}^h \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp(-\frac{x'^2}{2 \sigma^2})} \\
&= \frac{ \exp(-\frac{x^2}{2 \sigma^2})}
       {\sum_{x'=-h}^h \exp(-\frac{x'^2}{2 \sigma^2})}
\end{align*}

That is, we leave out the normalization of each index, because it falls out in the normalization of the entire kernel anyway.

\subsection{Convolving an image with a 2D Gaussian}
Look at all the programming-fucks I'm giving

\subsection{Comparing with Matlab's Gaussian Filter}
Thanks to the inherent separability of Gaussians, the implementation that convolves on one dimension at the time is slightly faster than the normal 2D implementation. However, when taking a difference image, it becomes clear that there is a difference between both implementations. The sum of squared error between both resulting images is in the order of $10^{-17}$. This difference is also found in the kernels as produced
